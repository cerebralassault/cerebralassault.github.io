I’m a **Windows Server Systems Engineer** (CONT) for the **Department of Energy**, based in the Pacific Northwest. My work focuses on server security, management, and compliance, where I specialize in securing and optimizing Windows Server environments, enforcing governance, and managing access policies within the DOE’s infrastructure. I work across both cloud and virtualized environments to maintain a strong security posture and ensure everything meets regulatory standards.

Outside of my professional life, I’m passionate about photography, especially capturing the essence of **street and nature scenes**. I also enjoy **board games** and various types of **gaming**, where I bring a blend of strategic thinking and creativity.

This is my page to post scripts I have built that I believe might be helpful to other people. If I've made it but I do not think others would benefit from it, I do not post it here.
