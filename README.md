I’m a **Windows Server Systems Engineer** for the **Department of Energy**, based in the Pacific Northwest. My work focuses on server security, management, and compliance, where I specialize in securing and optimizing Windows Server environments, enforcing governance, and managing access policies within the DOE’s infrastructure. I work across both cloud and virtualized environments to maintain a strong security posture and ensure everything meets regulatory standards.

Outside of my professional life, I’m passionate about photography, especially capturing the essence of **street and nature scenes**. I also enjoy **board games** and various types of **gaming**, where I bring a blend of strategic thinking and creativity.

This is my page to post **scripts I’ve built** that I believe might be helpful to others. If a script serves a unique need but wouldn’t benefit others, I don’t post it here. My goal is to share practical, effective solutions that can help others in their server administration and security work.
