# vCenter VM Dashboard (GUI)

## Why a GUI?
This script is built as a **point-and-click WinForms interface** instead of just raw PowerShell. The goal is to make it **as user-friendly as possible**, especially for admins who donâ€™t live in PowerCLI every day.  
- No syntax memorization needed.  
- Tabs are clearly labeled by task.  
- Outputs are in **tables** with copy/export options.  
- Defaults (like 14-day event window, 7-day snapshot check) are sensible but adjustable.  

Even inexperienced users can open the tool, log in, and immediately see useful vSphere data.

#### Note:  
This script uses [Elevated_PowerShell_Launcher_with_Execution_Policy_Bypass](https://gist.github.com/cerebralassault/10860fa69f7926fad8b1fa327ec7a650) as an optional batch wrapper.  
That wrapper can:
- **Bypass Execution Policy** with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` without changing system policy.  
- **Auto-elevate to Administrator** with `Start-Process -Verb RunAs`.  

To use it, paste the batch stub at the top of a `.cmd` file, then append this script.s

## Features
- **Credential prompt each run** (no caching, no saving).
- **Recent deletions** (last 14 days, event type filter).
- **Filter VMs** by **OS**, **Hardware Version (vmx-xx)**, **Domain**; **Export CSV**.
- **Old snapshots**: tree flattened, list older than **N** days (default **7**).
- **No VMware Tools** and **Outdated Tools** (ToolsVersionStatus2 / ToolsStatus).
- **Patch compliance**: Lifecycle Manager **baselines** for ESXi hosts.
- **WinForms UI**: fast DataGridView, zero external assets.
